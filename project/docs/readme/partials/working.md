The Availity Toolkit uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to automate your workflow. You should have installed Gulp when you installed [Availity Command-line (CLI)](https://github.com/Availity/availity-cli). You can verify by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

>
```sh
availity doctor
```

You should see output like this:

>
```sh
Checking for bower . . . OK
Checking for gulp . . . OK
Checking for git . . . OK
```

If you don't see "OK" for each line in the output, please install the required tools before proceeding with the Availity Toolkit.

### Workflow

please see Availity-Workflow for gulp information and how to set it up with toolkit.
